This dashboard is meticulously crafted to provide actionable insights into vessel trading patterns, activity trends, and congestion levels within the port. Leveraging Power BI's advanced capabilities, I have designed two pages to offer a detailed overview of port activities and congestion assessment, empowering stakeholders with valuable insights for strategic decision-making.

**Page 1: Port Activity Overview**

This page provides a comprehensive overview of vessel activities within the port, allowing stakeholders to identify trends and patterns in trading behavior. Key features include:

**Vessel Activity Analysis:**
Interactive visualizations display key metrics such as vessel activities, vessel actions, and vessel types, enabling stakeholders to understand trading patterns and distribution.

**Purpose and Activity Classification:**
Utilizing Power BI's DAX functions and measures, I have categorized vessel activities based on their purpose (e.g., loading, unloading, stopping) and activity level (e.g., operating, waiting).

**Trend Identification:**
Through trend analysis and time-series visualizations, stakeholders can identify peak trading periods, and emerging patterns, facilitating proactive decision-making and resource allocation.


**Page 2: Congestion Level Assessment**

This page allows stakeholders to assess congestion levels within the port, enabling them to evaluate performance and optimize operations. Key features include:

**Weekly Congestion Comparison:**
Interactive charts compare congestion levels of the last completed week with previous weeks, providing insights into congestion trends and performance changes over time.

**Congestion Metrics:**
Utilizing Power BI's DAX measures, I have calculated congestion metrics such as total vessels congested, unique vessels congested, peak congestion hours, and vessel turnaround time, enabling stakeholders to pinpoint congestion hotspots and potential bottlenecks.

**Data-driven Insights:**
By analyzing historical data and applying advanced measures, stakeholders can extract actionable insights to improve port efficiency, reduce waiting times, and enhance overall operational performance.


In summary, this Power BI dashboard exemplifies my expertise in data visualization, analysis, and extraction of actionable insights. Through meticulous use of Power BI's features, including DAX and interactive visualizations, I have created a powerful tool for maritime port analysis. I am confident that this showcase of my skills will demonstrate my proficiency in Power BI dashboard development and data-driven decision-making to potential recruiters and stakeholders.
